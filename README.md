Documentation for fields as part of the tj library

This folder contains several nifty Joomla! jfields created by us across various projects. It's fun to create these fields, and keep on improving them across projects.
Inputbox with character counter (textcounter)

This field is an extension to a normal text input field that displays a counter below the input box to indicate the character length of the field value. If the maxlength attribute is specified for the inputbox, the field can also display remaining characters. This field adds a new countertext attribute where you can specify the text that shows the counter. It's possible to use 3 replacement tokens {maxlength}, {used} and {remaining} which will dynamically be replaced with the right values when the field loads. The text and values load in a span element with a unique id so it's possible to style it independently.

Usage

        <field name="name"
            type="textcounter"
            countertext="Characters Used {used} / {maxlength} (Remaining {remaining})"
            maxlength="100"
            required="true"
            size="120"
            filter="safehtml"
            label="COM_EXAMPLE_NAME_LABEL"
            description="COM_EXAMPLE_NAME_DESCRIPTION"
            hint=""
            class="" />

Textarea with character counter (textareacounter)

Similar to textcounter, but for textarea fields.

Usage

        <field name="description"
            type="textareacounter"
            countertext="Characters remaining {remaining} / {maxlength}"
            maxlength="500"
            required="true"
            filter="safehtml"
            label="COM_EXAMPLE_DESCRIPTION_LABEL"
            description="COM_EXAMPLE_DESCRIPTION_DESCRIPTION"
            hint=""
            class="" />
